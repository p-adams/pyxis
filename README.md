# pyxis.ts
# An associative container for TypeScript
Pyxis has the following properties:

     a) Associative: values are referenced by key and not by position.
     
     b) Unique keys: each key in container is unique.
     
     c) Ordered: all keys are kept in order.
     
     d) Mapped: each entry associates a key to a mapped value.
     
Pyxis currently supports the following operations:

     1) empty : test whether container is empty or not.
     
     2) size  : returns number of entries in container.
     
     3) locate(key) : locates value of entry by key. 
     
     4) insert(key, value) : inserts a unique key into container in sorted order.
     
     5) remove(key) : removes key and its associated value from the container.
