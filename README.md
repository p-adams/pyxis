# pyxis.ts
# An associative container for TypeScript
Pyxis has the following properties:

1) Associative: values are referenced by key and not by position.
     
2) Unique keys: each key in container is unique.
     
3) Ordered: all keys are kept in order.
     
4) Mapped: each entry associates a key to a mapped value.
     
Pyxis currently supports the following operations:

a) isEmpty : test whether container is empty or not.

b) clear : empties container

c) size  : returns number of entries in container.
     
d) locate(key) : locates value of entry by key. 
     
e) insert(key, value) : inserts a unique key into container in sorted order.
     
f) remove(key) : removes key and its associated value from the container.
